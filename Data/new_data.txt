What are the advantages of this model?: This model is fast, lightweight, and doesn't require deep learning. It uses TF-IDF vectorization, making it efficient for small to medium-sized datasets.
Is this model fast?: Yes! It is fast and does not require GPU processing, making it lightweight and efficient.
Does this model need training?: No, it does not require training like deep learning models. It uses preprocessed text and vectorization to find the best match.
How is this model customizable?: You can add more Q&A pairs to the dataset to improve accuracy. The similarity threshold can also be adjusted for better results.
Why is this model transparent and explainable?: It uses cosine similarity, allowing you to see the similarity scores and debug why an answer was chosen. Unlike deep learning models, it is easy to interpret.
Can this model work offline?: Yes! This model does not need internet access or API calls, making it ideal for local applications.
Is this model expensive to run?: No, it is lightweight and computationally efficient, as it only uses NLTK and Sklearn.
Where can this model be used?: This model is great for FAQs, customer support, personal AI assistants, and chatbot development.
What are the limitations of this model?: This model does not handle complex context or deep logic. It uses keyword-based retrieval, meaning it cannot generate new responses.
How can this model be improved?: It can be improved by using word embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText, or BERT) or integrating it with a GPT-based system.
Can this model generate new responses?: No, this model only retrieves stored answers and does not generate responses like GPT-based models.
What should I do if I want an advanced chatbot?: You can combine this model with AI-powered models like GPT, fine-tuned BERT, or hybrid approaches for better accuracy.
